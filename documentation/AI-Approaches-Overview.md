# AI Approaches Overview:

The following subsections provide brief overviews of five separate AI approaches:

1. [Approach A - PDDL / Classical Planning](Approach-A)
2. [Approach B - Value Iteration](Approach-B)
3. [Approach C - Approximate Q-Learning](Approach-C)
4. [Approach D - A\* Heuristic Search](Approach-D)
5. [Approach E - Behaviour Trees](Approach-E)

Within each of these different approaches, we discuss our motivation for investigating the approach; the general theory behind the AI method; the trade-offs involved. Most approaches were explicitly used in developing an agent(s); some were not explicitly utilised, but instead inspired some aspect of an agent(s) development; and one approach was investigated but failed to be implemented due to various reasons (discussed in [PDDL / Classical Planning](Approach-A)).
