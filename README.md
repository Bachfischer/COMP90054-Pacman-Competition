# COMP90054 - Pacman Capture The Flag Project

This repository contains the documentation for the Berkley Pacman CTF Competition that was run as part of the COMP90054 course in Semester 2 at the University of Melbourne (the contest is described in further detail [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html)).

In accordance with the **COMP90054 Code of Honour** we are not allowed to share the code that we used for our agents with others. 

Hence, this repository only contains the accompanying documentation that was submitted at the end of the project.

Please head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Bachfischer/COMP90054-Pacman-Competition/wiki) in which we have documented and analyzed the performance of our Pacman agent systems.
